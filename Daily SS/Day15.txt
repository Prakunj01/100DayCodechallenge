ðŸš€100 Days of Code Challenge! ðŸš€

Hey fellow coders! ðŸ‘‹ I've decided to take on the #100DaysOfCode challenge to level up my programming skills, build awesome projects, and foster a daily coding habit. ðŸš€

Why am I doing this?
I believe in continuous learning and growth, and what better way to achieve that than committing to code every single day for the next 100 days! Whether you're a coding newbie or a seasoned developer, the challenge is designed for all.

What will I be working on?
I'll be focusing on my Problem Solving skills, improve myself and push myself everyday. The possibilities are endless, and I'm excited to see what I can achieve!

Follow My Journey:
I'll be documenting my daily progress on my GitHub repository. Check out my daily logs, see the challenges I overcome, and witness the projects I'm working on. ðŸ“ˆ
